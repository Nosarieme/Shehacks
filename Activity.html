    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

    <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <h3 style= "color: darkcyan">Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
          </ul>

    <h3 style="color: burlywood">Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time
      </ol>
    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of :</p>
      <li>lemon and coriander</li>
          <li>chili pepper</li>
      <li>lime and chipotle </li>
          <li>harissa and mint</li> or 
      <li>spinach and feta cheese.</li> <br> Experiment and see what works for you.

    <h3 style="color: blue">Storage</h3>

    <li>Refrigerate</li>
      <li>The finished hummus in a sealed container.</li><br> You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.<br>

    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
